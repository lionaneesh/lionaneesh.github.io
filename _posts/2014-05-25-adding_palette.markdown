Currently we are using a relatively ugly combobox for the intrument selection in Music Keyboard Activity. It takes up quite a lot of space and doesn't seem to be easy to interact with too. A better UI would be to use a palette instead. The palette would facilitate easier and cleaner instrument selection.
