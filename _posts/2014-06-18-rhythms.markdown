During the past week I have been working on adding rhythms/beats to the Keyboard Activity. The feature was inspired from the TamTam suite and we are trying to add it to Music Keyboard Activity. I have been able to get the basic beat working (without the toolbar). It currently plays a default beat (drum1kick) with the piano.

During the last meeting with Gonzalo we disucssed about the toolbar controls. We thought having 4 sliders as in TamTamMini is too space-demanding for Music Keyboard activity. So, we had ourselves brainstorm and get inspiration from all the (toolbars)[wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Design_Team/Toolbar_Catalog]. We concluded on having 1 toolbar for the beats manipulation and in that toolbar we'd have widgets (like the font size widget in Read) to change the tempo, beat complexity, beats per minute, volume etc.

This week I am working to get the initial prototype ready and we'll continue the discussion on UI in next meeting.
