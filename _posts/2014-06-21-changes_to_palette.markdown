The palette patch is almost ready for pushing in the codebase. I sent in the pull request some days back and Gonzalo (my mentor) made some useful comments.

- We have made our SVG icons white. They look prettier now. 
- We have resized the palette button to show the full instrument names.
- We have also resized the palette, it was overflowing the screen on my XO-4.
