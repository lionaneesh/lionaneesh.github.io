I have made the first prototype for the Rhythms UI, its not very impressive at present it seems to be working, and I can change the beat parameters through the widgets. The next thing is to make it look better and to make it more user friendly. I'll have a meeting with Gonzalo and Walter about this and hopefully we'll brainstorm and come up with something.
